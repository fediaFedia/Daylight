Make your computer's style more responsive to [Daytime and Nighttime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln2Xq8fCNI8) cycles (science approves!)
If you already use Rainmeter, now there's no point in using any additional 3rd party apps to change your wallpaper, system theme, dock theme etc. With Daylight you can set all your stuff to change depending on sunrise / sunset, or just simply when you feel like it!

Feel free to use this tool as both standalone, or integrate it into your skins.
Only thing you need to worry about is getting the user to enter their coordinates (Latitude / Longitude) into the settings, the rest is easy!

## Quick Documentation:

The Skin, depending on its settings, will change the variable "DarkMode" to either 0 or 1 in @Resources\Global.inc
You can change your Rainmeter skins to look at that variable and switch their design to dark mode / light mode. Easy!
